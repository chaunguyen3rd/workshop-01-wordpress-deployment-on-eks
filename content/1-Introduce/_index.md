- **Fully Managed Service**: EKS is a fully managed service by AWS, handling the complexities of Kubernetes infrastructure.
- **Simplified Deployment**: It simplifies the deployment, management, and scaling of Kubernetes clusters in the cloud.
- **Automatic Updates**: EKS provides automatic updates and security patches, ensuring your clusters are always up-to-date.
- **High Availability**: The service offers high availability across multiple AWS regions, ensuring reliability and uptime.
- **Seamless Integration**: EKS integrates seamlessly with other AWS services, enhancing the capabilities of your Kubernetes applications.
- **Focus on Innovation**: EKS allows developers to focus on innovation and application development, rather than infrastructure management.

**WordPress** is a popular open-source content management system (CMS) that allows users to easily create and manage websites without needing extensive coding knowledge. 

By the end of this workshop, you could effectively manage and scale WordPress in a cloud-native environment. Through hands-on exercises, you'll know how to containerize WordPress, deploy it on a Kubernetes cluster using EKS, and leverage AWS services to ensure high availability, security, and performance. By the end of the workshop, you'll be prepared to deploy and manage a production-ready WordPress site on EKS, utilizing best practices for cloud-based infrastructure.
